# Research Scripts

Standalone research and prototyping scripts archived from the main codebase.
These are **not** part of the production simulation pipeline — they were used for
early-phase exploration and algorithm comparison.

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `path_minimization.py` | Phase 1 TSP route-length prototype (pygame) |
| `distribution_clustering.py` | Clustering algorithm comparison lab |
| `clustering_research_visual.py` | Pygame clustering visualization |
| `clustering_advanced_algo_research_visual.py` | Advanced clustering comparison |
| `phase2_clustering_experiment.py` | Phase 2 clustering experiment harness |
| `pygame_renderer.py` | Pygame-based simulation renderer (deprecated) |
| `logger.py` | Legacy metrics logger (superseded by `metrics/metric_engine.py`) |
