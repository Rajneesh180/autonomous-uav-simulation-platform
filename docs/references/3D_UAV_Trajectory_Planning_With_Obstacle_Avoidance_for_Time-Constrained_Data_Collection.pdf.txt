3D UA V Trajectory Planning With Obstacle
Avoidance for UA V -Enabled Time-Constrained
Data Collection Systems
Jun Zheng , Senior Member , IEEE,a n dK a iL i u
Abstract—This paper investigates the three-dimensional (3D)
unmanned aerial vehicle (UA V) trajectory-planning problem in a
UA V-enabled data collection (DC) system, in which a UA V exe-
cutes a mission to collect time-constrained data in a geographical
area with spatial obstacles. For such a UA V trajectory-planning
problem, how to timely collect data, avoid collisions with spatial
obstacles, and complete DC with limited UA V onboard energy is a
big challenge. To address this challenge, the investigated problem
is formulated as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the
UA V’s total mission completion time subject to the time constraint
of collected data, the avoidance of spatial obstacles, and the energy
constraint of the UA V . To solve the formulated problem, the problem
is decomposed into a visiting sequence optimization sub-problem,
and a hovering position and ﬂying path optimization sub-problem.
Correspondingly, a genetic algorithm (GA) based algorithm, and
a successive convex approximation (SCA) based algorithm are
proposed to solve the sub-problems, respectively. Based on the
two algorithms, a 3D trajectory optimization algorithm is further
proposed to solve the main problem. Simulation results show that
the UA V’s trajectory planned with the proposed algorithm can
effectively reduce the UA V’s total mission completion time.

completing the DC mission. In many DC application scenarios,
collected data are often time-constrained and thus need to be
timely transmitted to a ground center through a base station
(BS) within a limited time [4]. However, if a UA V is far away
from a BS, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the BS may
not be able to reach a minimum level, resulting in the UA V
unable to transmit collected data directly to the BS. In this
case, the UA V has to ﬂy to a position closer to the BS for
transmission. This would cause a certain delay and thus affect
the timely transmission of collected data. Thus, the planning
of the UA V’s trajectory should consider the time constraint of
collected data. On the other hand, when a UA V ﬂies between
different DCAs, it may encounter various spatial obstacles such
as mountain peaks, signal towers, or high-rising buildings [5].
To avoid collisions with such obstacles, a common way is to
make a UA V ﬂy at a constant and safe altitude, which would
result in a two-dimensional (2D) UA V trajectory, and thus limit
the sufﬁcient utilization of a UA V’s high maneuverability in
space and degrade the overall system performance. Thus, it is
necessary to consider obstacle avoidance in a three-dimensional
(3D) UA V trajectory planning. In addition, since the onboard
energy of a UA V is limited, the energy constraint of the UA V is
also a concern in the planning of the UA V’s trajectory. Therefore,
it is necessary to consider all the above issues in the planning
of a UA V’s trajectory. However, to the best of our knowledge,
no previous work has studied the 3D UA V trajectory-planning
problem in a UA V -enabled DC system, while considering the
time constraint of collected data, the avoidance of obstacles,
and a UA V’s energy constraint, which is the motivation of this
paper.
In this paper, we investigate the 3D UA V trajectory-planning
problem in a UA V -enabled DC system, in which a UA V is
deployed to execute a mission to collect time-constrained data in
a number of DCAs in a geographical area with spatial obstacles.
The problem is formulated as an optimization problem with an
objective to minimize the UA V’s total mission completion time,
taking into account the time constraint of collected data, the
avoidance of the obstacles, and the UA V’s energy constraint.
To solve the formulated problem, the problem is decomposed
into a visiting sequence optimization sub-problem, and a hov-
ering position and ﬂying path optimization sub-problem. Cor-
respondingly, a genetic algorithm (GA) based algorithm, and
a successive convex approximation (SCA) based algorithm are
proposed to solve the two sub-problems, respectively. Based on
the two algorithms, a 3D trajectory optimization algorithm is

II. R ELA TEDWORK
The planning of a UA V’s trajectory is an important problem
in UA V -enabled DC systems and has been extensively studied in
literature [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16],
[17].I n [6], Y ou et al. studied a 3D UA V trajectory-planning
problem for maximizing the minimum DC rate from all senor
nodes (SNs), and proposed a hybrid ofﬂine-online optimization
method leveraging both statistical and real-time channel state
information (CSI). In [7], Wang et al. considered a UA V -assisted
internet of thing system in a sophisticated 3D environment
with imperfect CSI, and studied a 3D UA V trajectory-planning
problem for minimizing the total mission completion time, while
taking into account throughput and ﬂight movement constraints.
In [8], Li et al. studied a UA V trajectory-planning problem aim-
ing to minimize the total mission completion time by jointly opti-
mizing the UA V’s ﬂying and collection trajectory and proposed a
V -shaped collection trajectory to reduce a UA V’s collection time.
In [9], Chen et al. considered a multi-UA V assisted DC system,
and studied a multi-UA V trajectory-planning problem for maxi-
mizing the total throughput and energy efﬁciency of the system,
while taking into account the signal-to-interference-and-noise
ratio and fairness among heterogeneous ground users. In [10],
Y uan et al. studied the UA V trajectory-planning problem in a
UA V -assisted DC system, aiming to minimize the total mission
completion time by jointly optimizing the UA V trajectory and
the SN assignment. In [11], Nguyen et al. studied a 3D UA V
trajectory-planning problem aiming to maximize collected data
by using a deep reinforcement learning based technique. In[12],
Sun et al. considered a system where UA V is dispatched to
harvest solar energy and collect data from multiple smart de-
vices (SDs), and studied a 3D UA V trajectory-planning problem
aiming to achieve max-min fairness among SDs’ uploading data.
However, the aforementioned studies considered 2D or 3D sce-
narios with only delay-tolerant data. The solutions obtained in
these studies are inapplicable in scenarios with time-constrained
data.
For the UA V trajectory-planning problem in time-constrained
DC, many studies have also been conducted. For example, Zhang
et al. considered a cellular-enabled UA V DC and data transmis-
sion (DT) system, and studied a UA V trajectory-planning prob-
lem for minimizing the AoI of collected data with a proposed
sensing and transmission trade-off design [4].I n [13], Samir
et al. considered a time-constrained DC scenario in an Internet
of Things (IoT) network, and studied a UA V trajectory-planning
problem for maximizing the number of served devices, taking
into account collected data’s minimum amount and deadline
constraints. In [14], we considered a UA V -enabled DC scenario,
and studied a UA V trajectory-planning problem for minimiz-
ing the UA V’s total mission completion time with the time

constraint of collected data and the energy constraint of the
UAV. In [15], Li et al. considered a DC scenario in an IoT
network, and studied a UA V trajectory-planning problem for
minimizing the age of information (AoI) of collected data with
no knowledge of the sampling mode used by each SN. In [16],
Al-Hilo et al. considered a time-constrained DC scenario in an
IoT network, which uses a reconﬁgurable intelligent surface
to improve the UA V’s connectivity and energy efﬁciency, and
studied a UA V trajectory-planning problem for maximizing
the number of served devices. In [17], Gao et al. studied a
multi-UA V trajectory-planning problem for minimizing SNs’
peak and average AoI in wireless sensor networks. Nevertheless,
most of the above studies considered a constant and safe altitude
for a UA V’s ﬂying, which limits the sufﬁcient utilization of a
UA V’s high maneuverability in space, and degrades the overall
system performance. Relevant studies considering a variable
ﬂying altitude are limited.
III. S YSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULA TION
This section describes the system model and formulates the
3D trajectory-planning problem under consideration.
A. System Scenario
Consider a UA V -enabled DC system in which a rotary-wing
UA V is deployed to execute a DC mission in a geographical area
with one BS, K DCAs and various spatial obstacles, as shown
in Fig. 1. The DCAs are uniformly distributed in the area and
are denoted by A = {ak,k = 1,...,K }. During the process of
executing the DC mission, the UA V takes off from a starting
position and ﬂies to sense and collect data over theK DCAs using
onboard sensors and transmit collected data to the BS. After the
DC mission is completed, the UA V will ﬂy back to the starting
position. Assume that the UA V’s starting position is located
at (sT
0 ,H 0)in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system, where s0 =
[x0,y 0]T ∈R2×1 denotes the starting position’s projection on
the ground,H0 denotes the UA V’s starting altitude and T denotes
a transposition operator. The BS is located at (0, 0,Hb), where
Hb denotes the BS’ altitude. Each DCA ak is a small circular
area with center (aT
k , 0) and radius ra, where ak =[ xk
a,yk
a]
T
∈
R2×1 denotes the center’s projection on the ground. The UA V’s
trajectory is denoted by (q(t)T,H(t)),0 ≤t ≤Ttotal, where

q(t)=[ x(t),y(t)]T ∈R2×1 denotes the trajectory’s projection
on the ground,H(t) denotes the UA V’s ﬂying altitude andTtotal
denotes the UA V’s total mission completion time. The UA V’s
ﬂying speed is limited tovmax.
Consider that the UA V executes the DC mission in a
successive-hover-ﬂy (SHF) manner, whose effectiveness in the
UA V trajectory-planning problem has been justiﬁed in[10], [18].
Thus, the process of executing the DC mission can be divided
into two phases: hovering and ﬂying.
B. Hovering Phase
The hovering phase can be further divided into two sub-
phases: DC and DT.
1) DC Sub-Phase: In the DC sub-phase, the UA V needs
to hover over a DCA in order to sense and collect data. We
call the data collected in DCA ak “DATA_k” and let (˜qT
k ,Hk
q )
denote the UA V’s hovering position for DC in DCA ak, where
˜qk =[ xk
q,yk
q]
T
∈R2×1 denotes the position’s projection on the
ground and Hk
q denotes the UA V’s hovering altitude for DC in
DCA ak. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the UA V’s sensing range on
the ground is a small circular area with center position (˜qT
k , 0)
and radius rk = Hk
q ·tanθs, where θs denotes the maximum
sensing angle of the sensor. To make sensing successful, the
UA V’s sensing range should cover a DCA, i.e.,
∥˜qk −ak∥≤ rk −ra,k = 1,...,K. (1)
To measure if a data sensing is successful, we consider a
typical probabilistic sensing model in [4], [19], in which the
probability that the UA V successfully senses data in DCAak in
one time is deﬁned as
P 1
suc = e−τdk
q , (2)
where τ denotes a sensing factor, and dk
q denotes the distance
between the UA V hovering at(˜qT
k ,Hk
q ) and the center of DCA
ak. Obviously, we have
dk
q =
√
∥˜qk −ak∥2 +Hkq
2. (3)
Thus, the probability that the UA V successfully senses data in
DCAakin ns times is given by
Pns
suc = 1−(1−e−τdk
q )
ns
. (4)
For a successful data sensing, it is usually considered that
Pns
sucshould exceed a threshold ω, i.e.,
Pns
suc ≥ω. (5)
According to (4) and (5), the minimum time the UA V takes to
successfully sense data in DCA ak, i.e., the UA V’s DC time, is
given by
tk
c =
⌣
ns ×Ts = ln(1−ω)
ln[1−e−τ(∥˜qk−ak∥2 +(Hkq )2 )
1/2
]
×Ts, (6)
where
⌣
ns denotes the minimum number of sensing times, and
Ts denotes the time the UA V takes to perform sensing per time.
2) DT Sub-Phase: In the DT sub-phase, the UA V needs to
hover at a position where the SNR at the BS reaches a mini-
mum level in order for the BS to successfully receive DATA_k
from the UA V . For ease of exposition, let (˜pT
k ,Hk
p) denote
the UA V’s hovering position for transmitting DATA_k, where
˜pk =[ xk
p,yk
p]
T
∈R2×1 denotes the position’s projection on the
ground and Hk
p denotes the UA V’s hovering altitude.
Assume that the UA V hovers at (˜pT
k ,Hk
p). We consider a
probabilistic LoS model for the channel between the UA V and
the BS [20], [21].L e thk denote the channel coefﬁcient. Thus,
we have
hk =
√
βk˜hk, (7)
where βk and ˜hk denote the large-scale fading and small-scale
fading of the channel, respectively, and ˜hk is a complex-valued
random variable with E[|˜hk|
2
]= 1. According to [20],w eh a v e
βk =
{
β0dk

κβ0dk

, NLoSlink , (8)
where β0 denotes the path loss at 1 meter, αdenotes the path
loss exponent, κ(< 1) denotes an additional attenuation factor,
anddk
p denotes the distance between the UA V and the BS. Thus,
we have
dk
p =
√
∥˜pk∥2 +(Hkp −Hb)2. (9)
Let PLoS denote the LoS probability between the UA V and
the BS. According to [20],PLoS can be modeled as
PLoS(θk)= 1
1+g1 exp[−g2(θk −g1)], (10)
where g1 and g2 denote two environmental coefﬁcients, and
θk denotes the elevation angle between the UA V and the BS,
andθk = 180/πarctan((Hk
p −Hb)/∥˜pk∥). Thus, the expected
channel power gain between the UA V and the BS is given by
E[|hk|2]= PLoS(θk)β0dk
p
−α
+[ 1−PLoS(θk)]κβ0dk
p
−α
= ˆPLoS(θk)β0dk
p
−α
, (11)
where
ˆPLoS(θk)= PLoS(θk)+[ 1−PLoS(θk)]κ.
According to [20], ˆPLoS(θk) can be approximated to
ˆPLoS(θk) ≈PLoS,
where PLoS denotes the average LoS probability for a given
UA V trajectory. Thus,(11) can approximately be expressed as
E[|hk|2] ≈PLoSβ0dk
p
−α
. (12)
The expected SNR at the BS is given by
E[γk]= puE[|hk|2]
σ2Γ ≈ puPLoSβ0/σ2Γ

where γ0 = puPLoSβ0/σ2Γdenotes the expected SNR at 1
meter, pu denotes the UA V’s transmitting power, σ2 denotes
the noise power, and Γ(> 1) denotes an SNR gap [20]. Thus,
the expected achievable rate between the UA V and the BS is
approximated as

whereB denotes the channel bandwidth allocated to the UA V .
Based on the above analyses, to achieve a successful DT, the
expected SNR at the BS should meet the following condition:
E[γk] ≥γmin, (15)
whereγmin denotes an SNR threshold. The time the UA V takes
to successfully transmit DATA_k to the BS is given by
tk
s = Sk/E[Rk], (16)
whereSk denotes the size of DATA_k.
C. Flying Phase
In the ﬂying phase, the UA V successively ﬂies to visit its
hovering positions for DC {(˜qT
k ,Hk
q ),k = 1,...,K } and hov-
ering positions for DT {(˜pT
k ,Hk
p),k = 1,...,K } in a certain
sequence. Let π(k) ∈{1,...,K } denote the index of the kth
visited DCA. Thus, the UA V’s visiting sequence is given by
[π(1),π(2),...,π (K)] ∈Ψ, where Ψdenotes a set of all pos-
sible permutations. Since there are K DCAs,Ψis actually a set
of K! random permutations of integers from 1 to K, where K!
denotes the factorial of K.
Unlike [14], in which a 2D scenario is considered, we consider
a 3D scenario where the UA V does not ﬂy along a straight line
between two adjacent hovering positions at a constant and safe
altitude. Since there may exist obstacles between two adjacent
hovering positions, the UA V needs to ﬂy around or over these
obstacles to avoid collisions, resulting in the trajectory planning
between two adjacent hovering positions more complicated.
To make the trajectory planning tractable, a path discretization
method [5], [20] is introduced to discretize the UA V’s ﬂying path
between two adjacent hovering positions into L+ 1 path seg-
ments withL waypoints, as illustrated in Fig.2.T h eLwaypoints
are determined such that by ﬂying along the waypoints of
the path, the UA V can circumvent or ﬂy over these obstacles.
Obviously, if L is large enough, the path length between two
adjacent hovering positions would be much larger than the length
of a path segment. Thus, the UA V can be considered ﬂying
straightly at a constant speed on each path segment. Since the
durations the UA V ﬂies on different path segments are different,
the UA V’s ﬂying path between two adjacent hovering positions
can be represented by the UA V’s waypoints and ﬂying durations
on all segments of the ﬂying path.
There are three situations for the UA V’s trajectory between
two adjacent hovering positions:
S-1: from position (˜pπ(π′(k)−1),Hπ(π′ (k)−1)
p ) to position
(˜qT
k ,Hk
q ). In this situation, the UA V ﬂies from its hovering
position for transmitting data collected in DCA aπ(π′(k)−1) to
its hovering position for DC in DCA ak, where π′(k) is the
inverse function ofπ(k) and denotes the UA V’s visiting order
for DCA ak, and aπ(π′(k)−1) is the last visited DCA before
DCAak is visited by the UA V;
S-2: from position (˜qT
k ,Hk
q ) to position (˜pT
k ,Hk
p).I nt h i s
situation, the UA V ﬂies from its hovering position for
DC in DCA ak to its hovering position for transmitting
DATA_k;
S-3: from position (˜pT
π(K),Hπ(K)
p ) to position (s0T,H 0).I n
this situation, the UA V ﬂies from its hovering position for
transmitting data collected in the last DCAaπ(K) to its starting
position.
Note that in S-1, when π′(k)= 1, the UA V ﬂies from its
starting position to visit DCA ak ﬁrst. For ease of exposition,
we deﬁne (˜pT
π(0),Hπ(0)
p )=( s0T,H 0), i.e., (˜pT
π(0),Hπ(0)
p ) also
denotes the UA V’s starting position.
Corresponding to the three situations, we introduce three
types of waypoints to discretize the UA V’s path between
two adjacent hovering positions, respectively, i.e., the way-
points for collecting DATA_k, waypoints for transmitting
DATA_k, and waypoints for ﬂying back to the starting po-
sition. Let(wk,n

tively.
Fig. 3 illustrates the UA V’s mission execution time sequence.

To ensure that DATA_k is still effective after being received by

where Tk

E. Energy Constraint Model
The UA V’s energy consumption includes that for DC, that for
DT, and that for propulsion. Let Pc and Ps denote the UA V’s
power consumption for DC and that for DT, respectively. Thus,
the energy consumption models for DC and DT are respectively
given by

+Mug(H(Ttotal)−H(0)), (28)
wherev(t) denotes the UA V’s instantaneous speed,Mu denotes
the UA V’s weight,g denotes the gravitational acceleration and
Pp(v(t)) denotes the UA V’s power consumption for propulsion.
For a rotary-wing UA V ,Pp(v(t)) is given by
Pp(v(t)) =c1(1+c2v(t)2)
+c3
(√
1+ v(t)4
(c4)2 −v(t)2
c4
)1/2
+c5v(t)3, (29)
whereci,i = 1,..., 5 denotes a set of parameters which depend
on the UA V’s characteristics and environmental conditions, as
described in [22].
Since the UA V ﬂies back to the starting position after com-
pleting the overall mission, and the UA V’s starting speed and
ending speed are equal to 0, we have
v(Ttotal)= v(0)= 0,
H(Ttotal)= H(0)= H0.
By substituting these two equations into(28), (28) can be further
expressed as
Ep ≈
∫ Ttotal
0
Pp(v(t))dt. (30)
Moreover, since the UA V executes the overall mission in a
successive-hover-ﬂy manner, the UA V’s energy consumption for
propulsion can also be expressed as
Ep = Eh +Ef, (31)
where Eh and Ef denote the UA V’s energy consumption for
hovering and that for ﬂying, respectively.
By substituting v(t)= 0i n t o(29), we can obtain the UA V’s
power consumption for hovering, i.e.,
Ph = c1 +c3.
Thus, the UA V’s energy consumption for hovering is given by
Eh =
K∑
k=1
Ph(tk
c +tk
s). (32)
According to the analyses in Section III-C and Fig. 3,t h eU A V ’ s
energy consumption for ﬂying is given by
Ef =

Therefore, the UA V’s total energy consumption is
Etotal = Ep +Ec +Es, (34)
and the UA V’s energy constraint model is
Etotal ≤Elimit, (35)
whereElimit denotes the UA V’s maximum available energy.

In the UA V ﬂying process, the UA V should avoid collisions
with obstacles to ensure its ﬂying safety. Thus, the UA V’s ﬂying
altitude at each hovering position or waypoint should be larger
than the altitude of the obstacle at that position or waypoint
during the overall mission, i.e.,

G. Problem F ormulation
We consider the UA V trajectory-planning problem in a UA V -
enabled DC system shown in Fig. 1. Since the UA V executes
the overall mission in a successive-hover-ﬂy manner, the UA V’s
trajectory can be represented by Ω= {Q, π, W, T }, where π
denotes the UA V’s visiting sequence, Q denotes a set of the
UA V’s hovering positions, W denotes a set of waypoints on
each ﬂying path between different hovering positions, and T
denotes a set of ﬂying durations on all segments of each ﬂying
path between different hovering positions. Obviously, we have
π =[ π(1),...,π (K)],
Q = {˜qk,˜pk,Hk
q ,Hk
p,k = 1,...,K },
W = {wk,n

F0,
k = 1,...,K,n = 1,...,L },
T = {tk,n
Fs ,tk,n
Fs ,tn
F0,k = 1,...,K,n = 1,...,L + 1}.
Let Ω∗ denote the UA V’s optimal trajectory. The UA V
trajectory-planning problem under consideration is to ﬁnd Ω∗
that minimizes the UA V’s total mission completion time with the
time constraint of collected data, and the avoidance of obstacles,
and the energy constraint of the UA V , i.e.,
P0:

[π(1),π(2),...,π (K)] ∈Ψ, (42b)
(1), (15), (20)–(22), (25), (35), (37)–(41),
where (42b) guarantees that the UA V’s visiting sequence should
be a random permutation of integers from 1 to K, (1) guaran-
tees that the UA V’s sensing range should cover DCA ak, (15)
guarantees that the SNR at the BS should exceed a threshold,
(20)–(22) guarantee that the UA V’s ﬂying speed should not
exceed its maximum speed, (25) indicates the time constraint of
DATA_k, (35) indicates the UA V’s energy constraint,(37)–(41)
guarantee that the UA V’s ﬂying altitude at each hovering position
or waypoint should be higher than the altitude of the obstacle at
that position or waypoint during the overall mission.
Since the objective function (42a) and constraints (25), (35),
(37)–(41) and (42b) of P0 are non-convex, P0 is a non-convex
problem. Thus, it is hard to ﬁnd an optimal solution to the
problem. Next, we will present a 3D trajectory optimization
algorithm to ﬁnd a sub-optimal solution to the problem.
IV . 3D TRAJECTORY OPTIMIZA TIONALGORITHM
In this section, we ﬁrst decompose the formulated problem
into a visiting sequence optimization sub-problem, and a hover-
ing position and ﬂying path optimization sub-problem, and then
propose two algorithms to solve the sub-problems, respectively,
and a 3D trajectory optimization algorithm to solve the main
problem.
A. UA V Visiting Sequence Optimization
Let π∗denote the UA V’s optimal visiting sequence. Given the
UA V’s hovering positions and ﬂying paths between the hovering
positions, the visiting sequence optimization problem is to ﬁnd
π∗that minimizes the UA V’s total mission completion time, i.e.,
P1:
Objective:
min
π
Ttotal (43a)
subject to:
(42b), (25), (35).
According to (43), P1 is actually an asymmetric traveling
salesman problem, which can be solved by using an existing
algorithm, such as a greedy algorithm, heuristic algorithm, or
dynamic programming. Similar to [14], we use a GA-based
optimization algorithm to solve P1, which is described in Al-
gorithm 1.

chromosomes with probability Pcross and produce
new chromosomes;

the constraints of problem P1. If it does, retain it;
otherwise, discard it;

and calculate the ﬁtness value of each chromosome
according to (43a);
10: Perform l = l+ 1;
11: Until l ≥Y

the ﬁtness value of each chromosome;
13: Choose the chromosome with the minimum ﬁtness
value as the optimal UA V’s visiting sequence;
Output: the optimal UA V’s visiting sequence:
π∗=[ π∗(1),...,π ∗(K)].
B. UA V Hovering Position and Flying Path Optimization
Let Q∗,W∗, and T∗ denote the optimal Q, W, and T,
respectively. Given the UA V’s visiting sequence, the UA V hov-
ering position and ﬂying path optimization problem is to ﬁnd
{Q∗, W∗, T∗} that minimizes the UA V’s total mission com-
pletion time, i.e.,

Ttotal (44a)
subject to:
(1), (15), (20)–(22), (25), (35), (37)–(41).
Since constraints (25), (35), (37)–(41) are all non-convex,
P2 is a typical non-convex problem. Thus, it is hard to ﬁnd an
optimal solution to the problem.
To solve the problem, we ﬁrst consider the non-convex ob-
jective function (44a). According to (6), (16) and (23),w eh a v e

(45)
In (45), the fourth and ﬁfth terms are non-convex. To
tackle these two terms, we introduce two sets of slack
variables:{ϕk},{ηk},k = 1,...,K , where
ϕk =l n [ 1
1−e−τ(∥˜qk−ak∥2 +(Hkq )2 )
1/2 ], (46)
ηk =l o g2{1+ γ0
[∥˜pk∥2 +(Hkp −Hb)2)]α/2}. (47)
Thus, the fourth and ﬁfth terms in(45) can be replaced by convex
terms ∑K
k=1 [Ts ln( 1
1−ω)/ϕk] and ∑K
k=1 [Sk/(Bηk)], respec-
tively, with additional constraints (46) and (47). Accordingly,
constraint (25) can be replaced by

which is a convex constraint.
Next, we consider constraint (35). According to the analyses
in Section III-E, constraint (35) can be extended to constraint
(49) shown at the bottom of the next page, which contains the
following three non-convex terms:
√(tk,n

(51) and (52). Finally, we consider constraints (37)–(41). Since

Thus, the exponential term can be replaced by con-
vex term e−ψi,k
q with additional constraint (54). Accord-
ingly, for constraints (38)–(41), we introduce another four
sets of slack variables: {ψi,k
p },{ψi,k,n
Fc },{ψi,k,n
Fs },{ψi,n
F0 },i =
1,..,G ,k = 1,...,K ,n = 1,..,L + 1. The non-convex expo-

convex terms e−ψi,k
p ,e−ψi,k,n
Fc ,e−ψi,k,n
Fs and e−ψi,n
F0 , respectively,
with additional constraints. Since{ψi,k

{ψi,n

q }, for ease
of exposition, we will not unnecessarily give the formulas of
{ψi,k

Based on the above analyses, let L denote a set of all the
introduced slack variables, i.e.,
L = {ϕk,ηk,μk,n

ilar to [20], constraints (55i)–(55r) are obtained by replacing
the equality sign with an inequality sign from corresponding
constraints. Since constraints (55i)–(55r) are non-convex [23],
P2.1 is a non-convex problem.
To solve P2.1, we ﬁrst deal with the non-convex constraints
by ﬁnding the global upper bounds or lower bounds of the
non-convex terms in the non-convex constraints. For constraint
(55i), its right hand side (RHS) is non-convex. According to

cording to [23], all constraints of P2.2 are convex. Thus, P2.2
is a convex problem, which can be efﬁciently solved by using
CVX [24].
Based on the above analyses, P2 can be solved by solving P2.1
because P2.1 is equivalent to P2. Since the optimal objective
value of P2.2 actually provides a global upper bound to that of
P2.1, P2.1 can be solved by using an SCA method [14], [20].
Therefore, we propose a SCA-based optimization algorithm to
solve P2.1 or P2, which is described in Algorithm 2.
C. 3D Trajectory Optimization Algorithm and Computational
Complexity
The 3D trajectory optimization algorithm is based on Al-
gorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 proposed to respectively solve P1
and P2, as described in Algorithm 3. The main idea of the 3D
trajectory optimization algorithm is to alternatively optimize the
Algorithm 2: SCA-Based Optimization Algorithm.

completion time converges.
The computational complexity of the 3D trajectory opti-
mization algorithm mainly consists of two components: the
complexity of Algorithm 1 and that of Algorithm 2. Similar to
[14], the complexity of Algorithm 1 is approximatelyO(YZK )
and that of Algorithm 2 is approximatelyO((2KGL + 2KG +
GL+ 10KL + 12K + 5L+ 2)3.5 log(1/ε)), where Y and Z
denote the maximum number of iterations and the initial popu-
lation size used in Algorithm 1, respectively,(2KGL + 2KG +
GL+ 10KL + 12K + 5L+ 2) denotes the total number
of the optimization variables in P2.2, and ε denotes
a solution accuracy [14]. Therefore, the total computa-
tional complexity of the 3D trajectory optimization al-
gorithm is approximately O(L3(YZK +( 10KL + 2KGL)3.5
log(1/ε))), where L3 denotes the number of iterations in the
algorithm.
V. S IMULA TIONRESULTS
We show simulation results to evaluate the performance of
the proposed 3D trajectory optimization algorithm. We use
MA TLAB to conduct the simulation experiments, and use the
parameter values given in Table I[ 4 ], [14], [20] and Table II [5]
in the experiments.
For evaluation, a 2D avoidance trajectory optimization (AoI-
EaTO) algorithm proposed in [14] is used as a benchmark
algorithm. Unlike the proposed 3D trajectory optimization al-
gorithm, the AoI-EaTO algorithm assumes that the UA V ﬂies
at a constant altitude. In this case, only when the UA V ﬂies at

an altitude high enough can it avoid collisions with all obsta-
cles. Moreover, we introduce the following metrics: the UA V’s
trajectory, total mission completion time, average ﬂying speed,
total ﬂying distance, total hovering time and total ﬂying time.
Fig. 5 shows the UA V’s total mission completion time (Ttotal)
vs the number of iterations with the proposed algorithm in a
situation (Situation I), where Tk
limit = 45 s,k = 1,...,K and
Elimit = 280 KJ. It is seen that Ttotal quickly decreases and
tends to stabilize within a few iterations, which shows that the
proposed algorithm can converge quickly.
Figs. 6 and 7 show the UA V’s trajectories with the proposed
algorithm and the AoI-EaTO algorithm, respectively, in Situa-
tion I. Table III shows the other performance metrics with the
two algorithms, respectively. It can be seen that the UA V’s min-
imum total mission completion time (Ttotal
∗) with the proposed
algorithm is smaller than that with the AoI-EaTO algorithm. The
reason is that with the proposed algorithm the UA V can hover
at a lower altitude to collect or transmit data compared with the
AoI-EaTO algorithm. Based on the analyses in Section III-B,a
lower altitude for collecting or transmitting data always leads
to a shorter DC time or DT time for the UA V . Thus, the UA V’s
total hovering time with the proposed algorithm is smaller than
that with the AoI-EaTO algorithm, resulting a smaller UA V’s

energy consumption for hovering with the proposed algorithm.
As a result, with the proposed algorithm, the UA V has more
energy for ﬂying and thus the UA V’s average ﬂying speed is
larger than that with the AoI-EaTO algorithm. Moreover, the
UA V’s total ﬂying distance with the proposed algorithm is larger
than that with the AoI-EaTO algorithm. The reason is with the
proposed algorithm the UA V needs to maneuver around or ﬂy
over obstacles to avoid collisions, resulting the longer ﬂying
distance for the UA V compared with that with the AoI-EaTO
algorithm.
Figs. 8 and 9 show the UA V’s minimum total mission com-
pletion time (Ttotal
∗) and average ﬂying speed ( vavg ) with the
proposed algorithm under different energy constraints (Elimit),
respectively, where Tk
limit = 45 s,k = 1,...,K . It can be ob-
served that an increase in Elimit causesTtotal

vmax. The reason is that asElimit increases, the UA V can obtain
more energy to ﬂy at a faster speed, which would in turn lead to a
corresponding decrease inTtotal

certain value (e.g., 310KJ in Fig. 8) ,t h eU A Vw o u l dﬂ ya tvmax,

Figs. 10 and 11 show the UA V’s minimum total mission com-
pletion time (Ttotal

proposed algorithm under different time constraints of collected
data (Tk
limit), respectively, where Elimit = 280KJ. It is seen
that asTk
limit increases,Ttotal
∗ﬁrst decreases and subsequently
stabilizes, and meanwhile vavg ﬁrst increases and then tends
to stabilize. The reason is that when Tk
limit increases, the UA V
would have more time to transmitDATA_k. In this case, the UA V
would not have to ﬂy to a position closer to the GBS to reduce the
age of DATA_k, resulting in a decrease in the UA V’s total ﬂying
distance and thus an increase invavg given the energy constraint.
Consequently,Ttotal

Fig. 12 shows the UA V’s trajectory with the proposed algo-
rithm in a situation (Situation II), where the time constraints of
data collected in a1, a3, and a6 are set to smaller values, com-
pared with Situation I, i.e.,T 1
limit = 26 s,T 3
limit = 36 s,T 6
limit =
35 s, to investigate the impact of Tk
limiton the UA V’s trajectory.
Comparing Fig. 12 with Fig. 6, the UA V’s hovering positions
for transmitting data collected ina1,a3 anda6 in Situation II are
closer to the GBS than those in Situation I. This is because in
Situation II, the time constraints of data collected in a1, a3 and
a6 are smaller than those in Situation I. Thus, the UA V needs
to ﬂy faster and select hovering positions closer to the BS for
transmitting collected data in order to meet the time constraints.
Figs. 13 and 14 show the UA V’s total mission completion time
(Ttotal) vs the number of iterations, and the UA V’s trajectory

from those in Situation I. It is seen that similar to Situation

I,Ttotal also quickly decreases and tends to stabilize within a
few iterations, and the UA V can avoid collisions with spatial
obstacles during the overall mission as well, which further
demonstrates the efﬁciency of the proposed algorithm.
Fig. 15 shows the UA V’s total ﬂying distance with the pro-
posed algorithm vs the packet size of collected data (Sk), where
Tk
limit = 50 s,k = 1,...,K and Elimit = 300 KJ. It is seen
that asSk increases, the UA V’s total ﬂying distance ﬁrst remains
unchanged, then gradually increases, and tends to stabilize. The
reason is that as Sk increases, if the UA V’s hovering positions
for DT remains unchanged, the UA V’s DT time would increase,
which would result in the increasing of the age of collected
data. WhenSk is smaller than a certain value (i.e., 40Mbits), the
age of collected data is within the time constraint of collected
data and thus the UA V’s hovering positions for DT can remain
unchanged. As a result, the UA V’s total ﬂying distance remains
unchanged. WhenSk becomes larger, to meet the time constraint
of collected data, the UA V’s hovering positions for DT would
be closer to the BS to reduce the age of collected data. Thus, the
UA V’s total ﬂying distance would increase. However, whenSk
increases to a certain value (i.e., 90Mbits), the UA V’s hovering
positions for DT have already been closest to the BS. As a result,

the age of collected data cannot further be reduced and thus the
UA V’s total ﬂying distance would not continue to change asSk
further increases.
Fig. 16 shows the UA V’s total ﬂying time with the proposed

that the UA V’s total ﬂying time keeps increasing, but increases
slowly when Sk is small or large. The reason is that as Sk
increases, no matter whether the UA V’s DT time increases or
the UA V’s hovering positions for DT are closer to the BS, the
UA V’s energy consumption for ﬂying decreases, which would
reduce the UA V’s average ﬂying speed. Since the UA V’s total
ﬂying time mainly depends on the UA V’s average ﬂying speed
and total ﬂying distance, the UA V’s total ﬂying time keeps
increasing with the reduction of the UA V’s average ﬂying speed
and the increase of the UA V’s total ﬂying distance. Accord-
i n gt oF i g . 15, when Sk is small or large, the UA V’s total
ﬂying distance remains unchanged. In this case, the UA V’s
total ﬂying time only increase with the reduction of the UA V’s
average ﬂying speed, thus the UA V’s total ﬂying time increases
slowly.

VI. C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we investigated the 3D UA V trajectory-planning
problem in a UA V -enabled DC system, in which a UA V is
deployed to execute a DC mission to collect time-constrained
data in a number of DCAs in a geographical area with various
spatial obstacles. The problem was formulated as an optimiza-
tion problem with an objective to minimize the UA V’s total
mission completion time, taking into account the time con-
straint of collected data, the avoidance of the obstacles, and
the UA V’s energy constraint. To solve the formulated prob-
lem, the problem was decomposed into a visiting sequence
optimization sub-problem, and a hovering position and ﬂy-
ing path optimization sub-problem. Correspondingly, a GA
based algorithm, and a SCA based algorithm were proposed
to solve the two sub-problems, respectively. Based on the
two algorithms, a 3D trajectory optimization algorithm was
further proposed to solve the main problem. The simulation
results show that the proposed 3D trajectory optimization al-
gorithm outperforms the 2D benchmark algorithm in terms
of the UA V’s total mission completion time, and the UA V’s
trajectory planned with the proposed algorithm can avoid colli-
sions with obstacles and meet the time constraints of collected
data.
In this paper, we considered a DC/DT mode in which a
UA V performs DC/DT while hovering and used an energy
consumption model which results in a UA V to ﬂy over, not
around obstacles. For future work, it is interesting to investigate
a DC/DT mode in which a UA V performs DC/DT while ﬂying
in the planning of a 3D trajectory, and investigate whether ﬂying
around obstacles is better than ﬂying over obstacles in energy
saving for a whole 3D trajectory.
