# Phase 2 Summary — Constraint Realism Activation

Phase 2 transitions the platform from a static clustering simulator into a constraint-aware autonomous decision system.

## Major Outcomes
- Energy-aware routing implemented.
- Mission abort and return-to-base behavior integrated.
- Hard and soft environmental constraints activated.
- Visualization evidence pipeline established.
- Unified mission analytics centralized in MetricEngine.

## System Behavior Changes
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Infinite movement | Energy-limited movement |
| Always reachable nodes | Feasibility-based routing |
| Pure geometry | Risk and constraint trade-offs |

## Research Value
The system now demonstrates:
- Decision trade-offs
- Resource limitations
- Constraint influence on coverage
- Multi-metric evaluation readiness

## Metrics Enabled
- Mission Completion %
- Coverage Ratio
- Energy Efficiency
- Constraint Violations

## Visualization Evidence
Environment plots now display:
- Nodes
- Obstacles
- Risk Zones

## Significance
Phase 2 establishes operational realism.  
The platform is now suitable for:
- Reinforcement learning integration
- Comparative experiments
- Research publication groundwork

## Next Direction
Dynamic environments, temporal uncertainty, and adaptive learning layers.
