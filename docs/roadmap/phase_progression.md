# System Phase Progression

## Phase 1 — Structural Framework
Core architecture and modular system design.

## Phase 2 — Constraint-Aware Planning
Energy limits, return logic, feasibility checks.

## Phase 3 — Temporal Adaptation
Dynamic environment modeling and reactive replanning.

## Phase 4 — Semantic Intelligence
Multi-feature node representation and weighted clustering.

## Phase 5 — Learning Layer
Policy optimization via reinforcement learning.
